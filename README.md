# Async Notification System

## Description

It is a Java application designed to manage events and send notifications asynchronously through different channels (such as email and SMS). The system uses blocking queues and a thread-based model to handle the reception, processing and dispatching of notifications in parallel.

## Core features:

- **Event reception**: Events are queued for processing.
- **Event processing**: Events are processed and transformed into notifications.
- **Notification sending**: Notifications are sent through registered channels.
- **Monitoring and logging**: All events and notifications are recorded in a log file.
